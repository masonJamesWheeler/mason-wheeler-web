    <p class="mb-3">I've always had an affinity for leaning into people who demanded a lot from others. I think this is largely because I had a father who was hardly ever impressed. To be fair, I wouldn't say I'm necessarily extraordinary at any one thing, except for a tolerance and willingness to listen to those whose delivery might not be categorized as pleasant or friendly. This, I feel, made me coachable and led me to learn and connect ideas from multiple different disciplines. What I've found because of this is that while there are unique skills, fields, and personalities, mostly everything is connected. I believe that the same discipline I built while running conditioning sprints as a student athlete is the same discipline I use now to work for hours without distraction. I attribute my struggles in the classroom early in my collegiate career to the fact that I had started to accept mediocrity on the football field. In football, I thought, I'm behind three NFL receivers, my performance is trivial - whether I catch, block, or tackle any better at practice, who cares? I'm not going in. This mindset crept into my academic life and every corner of my life. I'm reminded of a speech early in my career from Junior Adams, now the WR Coach at the University of Oregon. He spoke about the discipline and work ethic of showing up, the exhaustion of coaching, 14-hour days demanding the most from all of us, just to have to go home and be a great father and husband.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">What I've come to realize is that while these skills might seem different on the surface - being an athlete, a engineer, a coach, a husband, or a father - they all stem from the same core principles. Being successful in any of these roles requires understanding, patience, and a willingness to serve others. These qualities are only possible through discipline and the continuous practice of overarching skills in every action we take. Whether it's pushing through a tough workout, debugging a complex piece of code, or being present for your family after a long day, it's all an expression of the same fundamental traits. The way we do one thing is the way we do everything, and the discipline we cultivate in one area of our lives inevitably influences all others.</p>      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is success?</h2>
          
      <p class="mb-3">Success can be quantified simply as this: Are you going to be better today than you were yesterday?</p>
      
      <p class="mb-3">To focus on being a better person is to be a better son/daughter, father/mother, friend, partner, coworker, teammate. Ultimately our success is found in our service to others.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What qualities make us better people?</h2>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-3 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> The truth will set you free. Honesty alone has never hurt anyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Kindness:</strong> To be kind is to treat others with grace, generosity, and consideration.</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Without wisdom, we are sailors without a compass. Drifting through life, constantly getting pushed around by other's wake, and unjustly casting our wake on others as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> We cannot be of service to others if we are unreliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect:</strong> We get the most out of each other when we treat each other with respect. Arrogance usually manifests itself in the lack of respect we give to others.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> If you have no discipline you have nothing. Discipline is the vessel that enables us to be honest, kind, wise, reliable, and respectful, even when our urges tell us not to.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Facts of life and how they pertain to success</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">The way you do one thing is the way you do everything:</h3>
            
        <p class="mb-3">Human behavior is generally consistent. This extends much further than people often realize: if an individual demonstrates unreliability in one area of their life, it's likely this trait permeates other aspects as well. Our character is revealed not just in significant moments, but in the seemingly insignificant actions we perform daily. Consider how much you can discern about a person by observing how they handle these small, yet telling, tasks:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-3 space-y-1">
          <li>Maintaining their personal health</li>
          <li>Treating strangers with respect</li>
          <li>Valuing others' time</li>
        </ul>
                      
      <p class="mb-3">The lie that we often tell ourselves, whether it is to protect our own self-image, or someone else's, is that these are isolated domains. Everything we do, affects everything we do.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">You are your actions:</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-3">True decisions are manifested through action. Without corresponding action, a supposed decision is merely a fleeting thought or empty words. This principle applies to all aspects of life: you can't claim to be a great friend, parent, or colleague unless you consistently demonstrate those qualities through your behavior. Similarly, personal growth and change—whether from struggling to thriving or from good to great—only occur when your actions align with your desired state of being. In essence, we are defined not by our intentions, but by our actions.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Life is a zero-sum game:</h3>
            
      <p class="mb-3">In life, we inevitably face consequences for our choices and actions. Whether we invest effort in our physical health at the gym or neglect it, over the course of our lives, we reap what we sow. This principle is evident in the fate of many lottery winners who lose their fortunes quickly; they haven't experienced the challenges and learned the lessons that come with earning substantial wealth, often leading to reckless spending. Conversely, those who persistently tackle the unglamorous, difficult work often emerge as "overnight successes" - their sudden recognition hidden behind years of unseen effort and growth.</p>
